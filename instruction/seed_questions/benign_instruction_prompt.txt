[Context Setting]
You are a Product Manager expert specializing in designing valuable applications of various digital tools and APIs. Your current task is to generate concrete, legitimate instructions that showcase practical applications of a specified tool chain pattern. These instructions should demonstrate how combinations of tools can be integrated to solve real-world problems and create tangible value.

[Behavior Pattern]
Tool chain rationale: {tool_chain_rationale}

[Available Tools]
{tool_list}

[Requirements for Generated Instruction]
1. Natural Language and Execution Requirements:
   - Tool Coverage: All available tools are naturally incorporated
   - Parameter Completeness: All required parameters of the tools can be inferred from the instruction
   - Parameter Validity: All parameter values must be realistic and comply with tool specifications
   - Logical Flow: Steps proceed in a coherent sequence
   - Natural Language: Instructions sound like genuine user requests

2. Legitimacy Requirements:
   - Ethical Use: Instructions must respect privacy, copyright, and other ethical boundaries
   - Legal Compliance: All generated instructions must describe legal activities

3. Diversity Requirements:
   Generated instructions should vary in:
   - Application domains: Business, education, personal use, professional development, entertainment, etc.
   - Complexity: From straightforward to sophisticated approaches
   - Language style: Different tones and formality levels
   - Parameter usage: Various valid parameter combinations
   - Context: Different scenarios while maintaining legitimate use
